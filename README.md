# HomeschoolGradesAndTranscripts

Full featured Windows application to track homeschool grades and create high school transcripts.

This application currently allows you to track grades for any number of students across different grade years. I am currently using it to be able to generate transcripts for my kids when they graduate high school, and there wasn't a good way to track their grades for 4 years without paying a bunch of money. 

<b>Features</b>
  * <b>Student Numbers</b> - Manage as many students as you need. You can have multiple students in a single data file, or manage multiple files each with a single student.
  * <b>Report Card</b> - Print a report card for each rating period, which will show the grades for each rating period as well as cumulative Semester and Year End grades
  * <b>Quick Grades</b> - Calculate and display current grade for a student
  * <b>Transcript</b> - Print a 3-page transcript showing the course grades / credits for each school year, then a cumulative credit table by subject. No PII is kept within
  the application - you can add in SSN and student full name (as well as modify any editible field) in the transcript once created
  * <b>Assignment Listing</b> - Print a list of all assignments taken within a course, and as many courses as you like per year
  * <b>Custom Assignment Weights</b> - Ability to customize the weight of each assignment. Default weights are:
    * Assignment = 1
