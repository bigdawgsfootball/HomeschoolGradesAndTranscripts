# HomeschoolGradesAndTranscripts

Full featured Windows application to track homeschool grades and create high school transcripts.

This application currently allows you to track grades for any number of students across different grade years. I am currently using it to be able to generate transcripts for my kids when they graduate high school, and there wasn't a good way to track their grades for 4 years without paying a bunch of money. 

<b>* 01/21/2020 UPDATE - </b>I have included an ability to generate transcripts. The 3 page transcript will fill out up to 14 courses per grade year, 4 grade years total, and calculate grades and credits for each grade year, direct from your gradebook entries. I have purchased the pdf editing software, so there is no more watermark on the template.

<b>* 12/16/2019 UPDATE - </b>Printing a report card is now completely configurable to the number of rating periods you have. Just make sure the rating period for each assignment is correct.

The data format is a json file. I am working to allow for multiple files, but right now there is only 1 file for everything.
<b>* UPDATE - </b>you can now have different gradebook files, with option to create new and change working file

There is a rudimentary feature for backup and version control of your gradebook data file using whatever backup features you already have (Google Backup and Sync, OneDrive, etc). 
<b>* 12/16/2019 UPDATE - </b>you can now select which folder is synched for backup. The program will copy your gradebook file to the backup folder, leaving your backup software to sync it. You can also restore from this backup location.

<b>If you want to try out the executable without compiling from the code, just let me know. I'll send you a link to install</b>
